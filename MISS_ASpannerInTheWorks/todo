01/05/18 DO: Diana series backstory
01/05/18            There was a small planet with an Arvonian research station
01/05/18            trying to replicate Skaaran cloaking large enough to hide the whole planet.
01/05/18            It failed and created a rift in the space-time continuum.  Somehow all the
01/05/18            Arvnonians also died in the rupture or evacuated.  TSN scientists or spies
01/05/18            learned about the evacuation, and decided to send in the Diana to try to
01/05/18            investigate and pick up anything they could.   The Diana arrived, got caught in
01/05/18            the anomaly (sending a distress signal) and crashes.  The crew learned about
01/05/18            the whale attractor technology, and of results of the failed experiment (but
01/05/18            not how to reproduce it).   The Arvonian AI in the research station survived
01/05/18            unbeknownst to the crew and hid in the Diana which was easy to infiltrate.
01/05/18            But when power went low, the AI hid and went dormant (like a flash drive), 
01/05/18            to be awakened once power was restored.
01/06/18 ADD: randomly compute shield band strengths (but one should be clearly lowest)
01/06/18 ADD: comms message to reveal the saboteur is an AI
01/06/18 ADD: a way for SCI+COMMS to hack back in (a la ST:BC)

01/07/18 FIX: display number of successful hack steps in a comms message
01/07/18 ADD: a way to restore the Diana to friendly or neutral side
01/07/18 BUG: Skaaran count should be 0 on difficulty level 1
01/07/18 BUG: Diana switching sides is still counted as an enemy in EnemiesLeft variable
01/15/18 ADD: way to relay KTANE result across another subnet or even Internet
01/15/18 ADD: # bombs = 1 (diff 1-5), 2 (diff 6-11)
01/15/18 BUG: Urgent message from DS1 about saboteur can happen after hacking

01/15/18 ADD: clue that the AI is Arvonian

2/2 ADD: maybe some friendly civilian ships to keep comms busy at the beginning

3/1 MAYBE: maybe change the station type to an industrial base?
        rename to something like 'TSN Shipyard' or similar

3/1 DO: pick a name for the Arvonian base
    https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx0c25saW5ndWlzdGljc3xneDo3MmI3YjlkNmI0ZTUxYzFl

3/1 DO: Short description for TSN Nexus:
           The crippled TSN Diana is now undergoing reconstruction at DS1, but the recent mission to recover it
           has attracted unwanted attention from the Arvonian fleets which are now advancing on DS1.  Your mission
           is to protect both DS1 and the Diana from the Arvonian invasion.

3/2 FIX: find a way to prevent "Diana created" spew

3/2 CHECK: whether can increase the size of Arvonian carriers

3/2 FIX: prevent players from creating Diana as a player ship, maybe rename the player ship?
        doesn't seem to allow it already

3/2 ADD?: handle EMP'ing the Diana

3/2 DO?: make Diana AI try to join nearest enemy fleet

3/2 MAYBE: add a planet by DS1 for cosmetic reasons, maybe use a tiny nebula on top of it for atmosphere?
