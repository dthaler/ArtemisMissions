01/05/18 DO: Diana series backstory
01/05/18            There was a small planet with an Arvonian research station
01/05/18            trying to replicate Skaaran cloaking large enough to hide the whole planet.
01/05/18            It failed and created a rift in the space-time continuum.  Somehow all the
01/05/18            Arvnonians also died in the rupture or evacuated.  TSN scientists or spies
01/05/18            learned about the evacuation, and decided to send in the Diana to try to
01/05/18            investigate and pick up anything they could.   The Diana arrived, got caught in
01/05/18            the anomaly (sending a distress signal) and crashes.  The crew learned about
01/05/18            the whale attractor technology, and of results of the failed experiment (but
01/05/18            not how to reproduce it).   The Arvonian AI in the research station survived
01/05/18            unbeknownst to the crew and hid in the Diana which was easy to infiltrate.
01/05/18            But when power went low, the AI hid and went dormant (like a flash drive), 
01/05/18            to be awakened once power was restored.
01/06/18 ADD: randomly compute shield band strengths (but one should be clearly lowest)
01/06/18 ADD: comms message to reveal the saboteur is an AI
01/06/18 ADD: a way for SCI+COMMS to hack back in (a la ST:BC)
01/06/18 DEL: remove CHASE_ANGER so won't chase player if taunted (can't change taunts, per race)
01/06/18 FIX: move GM Teleport Diana and Activate etc GM buttons under GM/
01/06/18 FIX: reveal Arvonians after get mission
01/07/18 ADD: <difficulty-1> small Skaraans
01/07/18 FIX: display number of successful hack steps in a comms message
01/07/18 ADD: a way to restore the Diana to friendly or neutral side
01/07/18 BUG: Skaaran count should be 0 on difficulty level 1
01/07/18 BUG: Diana switching sides is still counted as an enemy in EnemiesLeft variable
01/15/18 ADD: way to relay KTANE result across another subnet or even Internet
01/15/18 ADD: # bombs = 1 (diff 1-5), 2 (diff 6-11)
01/15/18 BUG: Urgent message from DS1 about saboteur can happen after hacking
01/15/18 ADD: mission success comms message
01/15/18 ADD: clue that the AI is Arvonian
01/15/18 ADD: timer to fail if you don't dock to receive orders in time
01/15/18 ADD: some friendly civilian ships to keep comms busy at the beginning
01/28/18 NO:   update bomb instructions, or real life script to talk about
01/28/18       containment area of the anti-matter core  (which is where spock died)
01/28/18       (NO since more confuses the issue)
01/28/18 ADD: support for a second player ship
02/02/18 ADD: support for a second player ship for the damcon buttons
02/02/18 ADD: only add DamCon buttons to one ship, not all player ships
02/02/18 BUG: odd wrapping in "As a result of the recent..." message
02/02/18 FIX: clean up 51362_1_* variables
02/05/18 FIX: limit sensor range like The Diana Operation did
02/07/18 ADD: more enemy ships to scale with # player ships (6 light, +6 more heavy carriers if second ship)
02/07/18      plus Skaraans per difficulty
02/08/18 FIX: add some monsters that live in the asteroid belt
               Biomechs - eat asteroids so appropriate for the asteroid belt (defends self)
                       stage 3 needs anomalies
               Shark - eats whales so ok only if there's also whales (defends self)
               Dragon - 
               Piranha - swarms, likes nebulae and wrecks, so probably skip it
               Charybdis - makes nebulas, so probably skip it, the only one that's NOT aggressive
               Space bug - follows and harasses biomechs
         1 ship:  4 NSECTS randomly placed + 1 biomech
         2 ships: +4 NSECTs randomly placed + 1 DRAGON
         Problem: Biomechs can't be used normally in a mission, you have to write lots of code to deal with them
         Option 1) Write code to make biomechs eat/evolve
            disadvantage is risk of random anti-proton numbers if bug is not fixed
            advantage is that biomechs give science vessel something to study
         Option 2) Use biomechs that don't evolve
            disadvantage is risk of random anti-proton numbers if bug is not fixed
            advantage is that they're consistent with an asteroid belt
            advantage is that biomechs give science vessel something to study
         Option 3) Don't use biomechs
            advantage would be that using something else might make beacons/tags more useful
            option 3a) use Sharks and Whales
                disadvantage - have to put back in whale stuff from last time, instead of something new
                advantage is that whales give science vessel something to study
            option 3b) use Charybdis and Piranhas
                disadvantage - uses nebulas instead of something new
            option 3c) use Dragon(s)
02/10/18 ADD: Destroyer (Rapier) side mission (get them to DS1)
02/10/18 ADD: Luxury Liner Avalon side mission (trade 200 energy for 2 coolant)

02/10/18 ADD: Science (Starseeker) side mission
02/10/18 FIX: replace base type with Deep Space changing to Command
02/10/18 FIX: Artemis and Intrepid should spawn pointing North
02/10/18 FIX: set initial DS1 missile store counts (2xLight Cruiser, +1xBattleship if Intrepid)
02/13/18 ADD: if_docked with player_name
02/19/18 FIX: side mission range should be 400 not 500 for a ship, or docked if a base.
02/19/18 NO: rescue missions normally don't send comms messages (which seems wrong to me)
02/19/18 NO: enhanced shield capacity should be +50% max shields
02/19/18 NO: set escape timer so never expires before Artemis docks
02/19/18 FIX: coordinates of NSECT generation to be in asteroid belt as it slants
02/19/18 FIX: remove "full 6 person" text due to if_damcon_members bug
02/19/18 FIX: mention secondary mission
02/19/18 FIX: remove MaxBombs bumping to 2
02/19/18 BUG: Mission Success when Diana destroyed when no enemies exist
02/19/18 BUG: Rapier stopped before 400 from DS1
02/19/18 FIX: increased Skaraan difficulty
02/19/18 ADD: more protection around AB1, like a carrier defending it
02/19/18 FIX: set side mission comms to SIDE
02/20/18 FIX: no monsters should start tagged
02/20/18 FIX: make Rapier actually tractor to docked like Diana does
02/21/18 FIX: lose if you ignore the bomb warning and never dock
02/21/18 FIX: add more flavortext about saboteur, after you board and take Diana back over
02/21/18 FIX: require defusing bomb before mission is complete
02/22/18 FIX: scale monster difficulty - 4 NSECTs might be too many since PIRA's spawn, maybe drop to 2
02/22/18 ADD: Rapier should need to follow you to DS1
02/24/18 FIX: Skaraans didn't seem to attack us, or be difficult

2/2 ADD: make Pegasus side mission use Comms buttons

3/1 DO: pick a name for the Arvonian base
    https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx0c25saW5ndWlzdGljc3xneDo3MmI3YjlkNmI0ZTUxYzFl

3/1 DO: Short description for TSN Nexus:
           The crippled TSN Diana is now undergoing reconstruction at DS1, but the recent mission to recover it
           has attracted unwanted attention from the Arvonian fleets which are now advancing on DS1.  Your mission
           is to protect both DS1 and the Diana from the Arvonian invasion.

3/2 FIX: find a way to prevent "Diana created" spew
            topSpeed = 0
            turnRate = 0

3/2 CHECK: whether can increase the size of Arvonian carriers

3/2 FIX: prevent players from creating Diana as a player ship, maybe rename the player ship?
        doesn't seem to allow it already

3/2 ADD?: handle EMP'ing the Diana

3/2 DO?: make Diana AI try to join nearest enemy fleet

3/2 MAYBE: add a planet by DS1 for cosmetic reasons, maybe use a tiny nebula on top of it for atmosphere?
