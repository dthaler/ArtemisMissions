Might want a different name to not be so obvious
This mission is a follow-up from the Diana Operation
It requires an industrial/civilian base (not military or science), preferably industrial
The Diana is in drydoc there and is not used, except perhaps the comms station
There are asteroid belts, an arvonian base, and arvonian carriers
The fighting should take place with fighters in an area full of asteroid belts
Partway through the mission, sabotage happens on the base and a ship must dock,
    and send an away team to disarm a bomb (Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes)
    While sabotaged, maybe all production halts...
Once done, the away team can rejoin the crew if the ship docks
The sabotage happens again periodically, and it is revealed that the sabotage
    apparently came from the Diana... was there a stowaway?  did a saboteur
    just go there to hide out?
If blow up the Diana, then lose the special blackhole tech and all clues
To win: defeat the Arvonians
To lose: lose the base, or lose the Diana

How resolve the saboteur?  Maybe it's an AI in the Diana's (or station's) computer and 
    you have to EMP the Diana/station and/or do something from the Diana Comms station
    maybe convince the AI to transfer (via comms or shuttle or AI-piloted Diana) 
    to the Artemis or to a *shuttle* and sabotage that

Once the Artemis is sabotaged, you have to lose Artemis to get rid of the AI
If a shuttle is sabotaged, you can lose the shuttle to get rid of the AI
But we would like the AI to survive somehow for the next episode, so leaving it on
    the Diana would ensure that

wiki has about Arvonians
    Arvonians are peace-loving, sensitive people who respect life in all of its forms. 
    They are ruled by a sentient computer that appears to be concerned only with 
    manipulating events for its own good, and the good of its people. Because the 
    Arvonians respect even Artificial Intelligence as a living thing, Arvonians prefer 
    to use fighter craft instead of guided drones.
