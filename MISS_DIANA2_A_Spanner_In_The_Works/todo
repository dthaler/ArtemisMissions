2/1 DO: write a mission intro that's a follow-up from the Diana Operation
        The crippled TSN Diana is now undergoing reconstruction at DS1, but the recent mission to recover it
        has attracted more attention from the Arvonian fleets which are now advancing on DS1.  Your mission
        is to protect both DS1 and the Diana from the Arvonian invasion.
