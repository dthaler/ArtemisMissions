3/1 DO: pick a name for the Arvonian base
    https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx0c25saW5ndWlzdGljc3xneDo3MmI3YjlkNmI0ZTUxYzFl

3/1 DO: Short description for TSN Nexus:
           The crippled TSN Diana is now undergoing reconstruction at DS1, but the recent mission to recover it
           has attracted more attention from the Arvonian fleets which are now advancing on DS1.  Your mission
           is to protect both DS1 and the Diana from the Arvonian invasion.

3/2 MAYBE: have a bomb timer in the mission

3/2 MAYBE: should Diana be a player or NPC ship?
            NPC ship means AI can commandeer it

AME bugs:
    can have multiple comms types in a comms message (contrary to what mission file docs says)
    Station properties should not allow "with player slot"
    canBuild can be set to yes/no but doesn't have that for testing against
