There will be two ships: Artemis (a Carrier, Dreadnought, or Battleship), and Diana (Light Cruiser)

Just before beginning the game:
* Make sure one or more members of the Diana crew have the Tricord-AR app on
  some device.  Multiple devices are preferred.
* Make sure a GM console is connected.
* Welcome the players and reiterate the backstory, for flavor
* Remind the Comms officers to watch for Alert type messages, which are essential to the mission
* Tell them an Away Team will be needed on this mission, and we recommend
  that the Away Team take a communicator with them when they go.
* Remind them that sensor range is 16k
* Optionally tell them that this mission might involve some highly experimental equipment.
  If your ship is equipped with such equipment and notice any sensor glitches now and then,
  it's probably due to the fact that they're still experimental prototypes.

Main flow of events:

* When the Artemis starts, it gets (via Comms) orders to dock at science base SB01.
  When it does so, the Artemis is given phantom-whale beacons (controllable by Comms).
  Initially the ship will be given 8, and more can be picked up later.  Most ships
  have a capacity of 2 beacons, so once the initial supply is used up, only 2 more at
  a time can be obtained.

* When the Diana starts, it gets (via Comms) orders to dock at Houston Outpost.
  When it does so, the Diana is given a cloaking device (controllable by Comms),
  and Comms gets instructions to head into the wormhole:

   "Diana, we must resume the original mission.  You are instructed to travel back
    into the wormhole to the planet Elysia, retrieve a cargo of Cetrocite, and investigate
    the mainframe there.  If the mainframe contains a record of our plan to break up
    the Arvonian/Torgoth alliance, it is critical that the records be deleted or the
    mainframe destroyed to prevent Arvonian command from learning of the plan."

* When the Diana enters the wormhole, the planet Elysia appears.  The Diana should
  run into it to "land" on it, at which point a Comms alert indicates it has landed
  in a populated city and an Away Team can now disembark.
 
  The GM should point the Away Team at the "Cargo Bay" (the photo backdrop) and make
  sure they can scan it.  Tell them scans indicate that the mainframe seems to be
  somewhere up high in the city (hint at Maxis area).

* The Artemis crew should try to figure out how to use the beacons to optimum advantage.
  One great tactic is to use them to keep the Arvonians away from the bases.

* For a GM to tell what critical actions the Away Team did:
    a) Could just rely on the communicators and texts from another GM
    b) Could watch https://tricordarserver.azurewebsites.net/MissionStateView/Details/Diana3
    c) IFTTT can send a notification through the IFTTT App on a phone.  Enable it at
        https://ifttt.com/applets/94268014d-if-maker-event-my_test_event-then-send-a-notification-from-the-ifttt-app

* If/when the Away Team sends the fake message to the Torgoths, click the
  "GM->Away Team->Blame Torgoths" button on the GM console.

* If/when the Away Team destroys the Death Station plans, click the
  "GM->Away Team->Destroy Death Station plans" button on the GM console.

* If/when the Away Team sends the Death Station plans to the TSN, click the
  "GM->Away Team->Send Death Station plans to TSN" button on the GM console.

* Once the Torgoths have been blamed, the crews should try to get a Torgoth
  to destroy a whale (a fake one from a beacon is the easiest way) while not
  having a TSN ship around.  (More real whales or Torgoth ships can be
  spawned from the GM console, but this should not be needed.)  Once that
  happens, all Arvonians should switch sides to be friendly.

* The mission is successful once Arvonians have switched sides, and all Torgoths
  are defeated.
