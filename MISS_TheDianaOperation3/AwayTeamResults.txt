10-12 pieces revealed during normal mission + pre-scavenger hunt, not Away Team:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0) For years, the enemy Arvonian/Torgoth alliance has waged war against the United Space Faring Planets (USFP),
   defended by Terran Stellar Navy (TSN) ships such as the TSN Artemis and the TSN Intrepid.

1) Two years ago, TSN researchers began formulating a plan to try to break up the Arvonian/Torgoth alliance
   [, with whom the TSN has been at war for years].  This plan relied on constructing a device that was merely
   theoretical at the time, and to fully design and develop would require large amounts of a rare mineral
   known as Cetrocite, and so the Diana was sent on a secret mission into enemy territory to a planet that
   probes indicated had virtually unlimited deposits of Cetrocite.

2) However, the mission failed when both the Diana and the planet suddenly vanished into a newly appeared
   wormhole, which then disappeared as quickly as it appeared.  

   Months later, the wormhole reopened and a TSN Away Team took a shuttle into the wormhole and recovered
   the crippled Diana from the planet Elysia still inside the wormhole, and returned the Diana to TSN space,
   after discovering that generations had passed on Elysia due to the time differential inside.

2b) [FIND COLIN CHICK RECORD]

3) Repairs on the heavily damaged Diana continued for many months, until its computer banks were finally
   fully restored, whereupon it was discovered that it had been infected with an Arvonian AI that had been
   dormant in damaged memory banks and had been reawakened when the memory was repaired.  The AI was
   eventually neutralized and interrogated.

4) We have now learned from interrogating the Arvonian AI that it originated from a mainframe on Elysia
   and had infected the Diana when the Diana began scanning the planet.  

   For its secret mission into enemy space, the Diana had been outfitted with an experimental cloaking device,
   cobbled together from parts salvaged from a Skaraan wreck.

   The AI discovered the cloaking device and had attempted to sabotage it, but in so doing caused the Diana
   to crash on the planet and much of the computer record was lost as a result.  The AI does not know
   what caused the wormhole to appear.

5) Now that the Diana is restored to normal operation and scientists predict that another opening of the
   wormhole is imminent, we must resume the original mission.

   The Artemis must defend TSN space while the Diana heads back to Elysia to retrieve a cargo of Cetrocite
   and investigate the mainframe.

   If the mainframe contains a record of the plan to break up the enemy alliance, it is critical that the
   records be deleted or the mainframe destroyed to prevent Arvonian command from learning of the plan.

The Away Team can learn/do the following things:
------------------------------------------------
LOCATION/TARGET IMAGES:
* Station comms
* Station science
* Station history
* Station cargo bay
* Station mainframe core

   [LOCATION: STATION COMMS?]
0) INFO: When the Diana originally approached Elysia and started scanning the planet, the Arvonian mainframe
   infected the Diana with the AI via the Diana's comms/sensor systems.
   [THIS IS A DUP OF ABOVE]
   POSSIBLE ACTION: establish communication link to Diana?

   [LOCATION: STATION SCIENCE?]
1) INFO: Analysis of the wormhole creation:
   When the experimental cloaking device was sabotaged, it caused strange power fluctuations that
   interacted with Elysia's magnetic Cetrocite field, creating a rift in the space/time continuum.
   The rift caused the wormhole to appear, and the Elysia and Diana to get drawn into it, and the Diana
   then crashed on Elysia.

   [LOCATION: STATION SCIENCE?]
1b) Subsequent analysis indicates a theory of how to repair the rift in the space/time continuum:

   [LOCATION: STATION COMMS? after pre-req of #1]
   POSSIBLE ACTION: send to the Diana:
      "Diana, Elysia Mainframe analysis indicates that reversing the polarity of the cloaking device
       while in the proximity of Elysia's magnetic Cetrocite field should repair the rift in the
       space/time continuum that caused the wormhole.  This would return Elysia to normal space,
       but would likely destroy the cloaking device in the process."

   [LOCATION: STATION HISTORY (not CORE?)]
2) The Arvonian mainframe contains a record of the TSN plan to break up the Arvonian/Torgoth alliance.

   [LOCATION: STATION COMMS? after pre-req of #2]
   POSSIBLE ACTION: hack it to send a message to Arvonian command saying:
      "Arvonian Command, sensors report that the Torgoth are preparing an assault on the space whales
       in this sector!"
   POSSIBLE ACTION: open channel to Arvonian command before hacking it and before destroying the records
      (make sure this isn't too easy)
      [prereq: open channel to Diana]
   POSSIBLE ACTION: delete the records
   POSSIBLE ACTION: destroy the mainframe (make sure this isn't too easy)
   POSSIBLE ACTION: do nothing

   [LOCATION: STATION CORE (not HISTORY?)]
3) The Arvonian AI in the Elysia mainframe has figured this out, analyzed what happened (remember generations
   have passed due to the time differential) and thinks it might be able to recreate this effect, and use
   it as a weapon to destroy (or at least neutralize) other entire planets like Earth, thus winning the war.

   POSSIBLE ACTION: destroy Death Station plans so no one can get them
   POSSIBLE ACTION: transmit Death Station plans to TSN command for analysis [LOCATION: STATION COMMS?]
      [prereq: open channel to Diana]
   POSSIBLE ACTION: open channel to Arvonian command before hacking it and before destroying the records
      [prereq: open channel to Diana]
   POSSIBLE ACTION: do neither

   [LOCATION: STATION CARGO BAY?]
5) Cetrocite cargo

   POSSIBLE ACTION: get it
