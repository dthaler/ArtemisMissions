{

1/2 FIX: create non-placeholder images for the away team mission, using images from Mark

1/1 COPY: mission to server

---

2/2 FIX? Disallow spawning Intrepid, say should be Diana

2/2 FIX? disallow cloaking device with jump drive

2/2 ADD: allow option for Diana's shuttle to enter wormhole instead of Diana

2/2 ADD: Mark's idea...
         Maybe Diana has to spend a cumulative amount of time in the vicinity of the colony, but there are 
         regular patrols that pass close that Diana should avoid.  
            * make the setup match M1 a little less in terms of stations, NPC ships
                maybe put an arvonian base closer to Elysia?

2/2 ADD: side missions to keep Comms busy

---

3/2 ADD: make Diana have to relay message from Away Team to TSN Command, unless Wormhole destroyed first
              GM button: Away Team/Send plans to TSN
              GM button: Away Team/Send false message to Arvonians about Torgoths
         disadvantage is comms officer might not notice it, and harder to explain when there are two player ships

3/2 DEL: whale pod

3/2 BUG: when GM destroys death station plans, GM button doesn't disappear

3/2 ADD: video instructions on how phantom whale beacons work

3/2 Q: can there be "shield" frequencies of a black hole?
