investigate client crashing bug!

1/2 FIX? Lessen button popup to 60 seconds or remove comms refresh?
            "Handle ship-specific buttons"
            CommsButtonRefreshTimer
        * engage cloak, verify Disengage is shown to Diana, log out, log back in, Disengage is never shown
            CommsButtonRefreshTimer is never started
                set to 60 when Artemis docks at SB01
                reset to 60 when expires and TsnCommandGaveArtemisMission==2 (after Artemis docks at SB01)
        * check logic of when it's set up
        * add a GM function to set it
     DNTT remove GM function to delete Torgoth ships

2/2 FIX? Disallow spawning Intrepid, say should be Diana

1/2 ADD: allow option for Diana's shuttle to enter wormhole instead of Diana

1/2 ADD: away team app/investigation
         P2 have to learn there's a master AI in the mainframe
          * Secretly, the motivation is to create a blackhole/wormhole construction device
            scientists need to analyze the cetrocite field around Elysia to try to recreate it
          * can we somehow use HID lamps as a console to interact with?
               CRUX is output only, but could be paired with a regular keyboard
               keyboard is input/output
          * When the Diana approached Elysia and started scanning the planet, the Arvonian AI
            already on Elysia infected the Diana via the comms/sensor systems, and tried to sabotage
            the Diana's cloaking device.  However in doing so, something went wrong with the experimental device
            due to the interaction between the experimental system, the sabotage, and Elysia's gravity/magnetic field,
            and it created a rift in the space/time, which caused the wormhole to appear, and the Elysia and Diana
                    to get stuck in it, and the Diana then crashed on Elysia.
          * The master AI in the Elysia mainframe has analyzed what happened (remember generations have passed 
            due to the time differential) and thinks it might be able to recreate this effect, and use it as 
            a weapon to destroy (or at least neutralize) other entire planets like Earth, thus
            winning the war.   (The AI that infected the Diana does not have the details since it was 
            dormant since the crash, and the Dianas records were too damaged in the crash for the AI to 
            figure out anything similar after reawakening.)
          * During the mission, the Away Team will learn the truth from the mainframe AI, and maybe even get 
            the plans to create this super weapon (Death Station).  Will they:
                a)  Try to provide the super-weapon plans to TSN command? or
                b)  Destroy them so no one gets them?

---

2/2 ADD: Mark's idea...
         Maybe Diana has to spend a cumulative amount of time in the vicinity of the colony, but there are 
         regular patrols that pass close that Diana should avoid.  
            * make the setup match M1 a little less in terms of stations, NPC ships
                maybe put an arvonian base closer to Elysia?

2/2 ADD: side missions to keep Comms busy

---

3/2 ADD: make Diana have to relay message from Away Team to TSN Command, unless Wormhole destroyed first
              GM button: Away Team/Send plans to TSN
              GM button: Away Team/Send false message to Arvonians about Torgoths
         disadvantage is comms officer might not notice it, and harder to explain when there are two player ships

3/2 DEL: whale pod

3/2 BUG: when GM destroys death station plans, GM button doesn't disappear

3/2 ADD: video instructions on how phantom whale beacons work

3/2 Q: can there be "shield" frequencies of a black hole?
