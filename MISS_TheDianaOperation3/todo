1/2 ADD: give mission to Diana
         Diana x2:
            Task Succeeded - Diana Docked
            GM give Diana mission
            * mention wormhole opening in mission instructions
            * mention "using Skaraan technology" or "salvaged from a Skaraan" wreck regarding cloaking device

1/2 ADD: GM logic for result of Away Team
         ideas: what if have to get Arvonian AI to participate in the phantom whale ruse?
            e.g. transmit an Arvonian alert in Arvonian coded message?

1/2 ADD: Mark's idea.. Artemis has to direct Diana away from enemy ships as well as draw enemy ships off Diana. 
         (limited sensor ranges and nebula clouds?)
         Though I like the idea, I hesitate to rely on ship-to-ship comms since its been unreliable and 
        difficult to use in a noisy environment.
            * When cloaking device is engaged, set sensor power to very low/off

1/2 ADD: Mark's idea...
         Maybe Diana has to spend a cumulative amount of time in the vicinity of the colony, but there are 
         regular patrols that pass close that Diana should avoid.
