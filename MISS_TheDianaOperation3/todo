1/2 ADD: away team app/investigation
          * have to learn there's a master AI in the mainframe
          * Secretly, the motivation is to create a blackhole/wormhole construction device
            scientists need to analyze the cetrocite field around Elysia to try to recreate it
          * can we somehow use HID lamps as a console to interact with?
               CRUX is output only, but could be paired with a regular keyboard
               keyboard is input/output
          * When the Diana approached Elysia and started scanning the planet, the Arvonian AI
            already on Elysia infected the Diana via the comms/sensor systems, and tried to sabotage
            the Diana's cloaking device.  However in doing so, something went wrong with the experimental device
            due to the interaction between the experimental system, the sabotage, and Elysia's gravity/magnetic field,
            and it created a rift in the space/time, which caused the wormhole to appear, and the Elysia and Diana
                    to get stuck in it, and the Diana then crashed on Elysia.
          * The master AI in the Elysia mainframe has analyzed what happened (remember generations have passed 
            due to the time differential) and thinks it might be able to recreate this effect, and use it as 
            a weapon to destroy (or at least neutralize) other entire planets like Earth, thus
            winning the war.   (The AI that infected the Diana does not have the details since it was 
            dormant since the crash, and the Dianas records were too damaged in the crash for the AI to 
            figure out anything similar after reawakening.)
          * During the mission, the Away Team will learn the truth from the mainframe AI, and maybe even get 
            the plans to create this super weapon (you know a death star).  Will they:
                a)  Try to provide the super-weapon plans to TSN command? or
                b)  Destroy them so no one gets them?
            Planet Exterminator?

2/2 ADD: Mark's idea...
         Maybe Diana has to spend a cumulative amount of time in the vicinity of the colony, but there are 
         regular patrols that pass close that Diana should avoid.  

2/2 FIX: side missions

2/2 FIX: make the setup match M1 a little less in terms of stations, NPC ships

2/2 FIX: maybe have a Comms msg come from Arvonian to Torgoth when warned
         and have the Torgoth respond something like "Any whales outside of your territory are none of your business"
         and then tell the regular message to the Diana about alliance breakup ready

---

3/2 ADD: make Diana have to relay message from Away Team to TSN Command, unless Wormhole destroyed first
              GM button: Away Team/Send plans to TSN
              GM button: Away Team/Send false message to Arvonians about Torgoths
         disadvantage is comms officer might not notice it, and harder to explain when there are two player ships

3/2 DEL: whale pod

3/2 BUG: when GM destroys death station plans, GM button doesn't disappear

3/2 ADD: video instructions on how phantom whale beacons work

3/2 Q: can there be "shield" frequencies of a black hole?
