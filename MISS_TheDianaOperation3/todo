1/2 ADD: give mission to Diana
         Diana x2:
            Task Succeeded - Diana Docked
            GM give Diana mission
            * mention wormhole opening in mission instructions

1/2 ADD: GM logic for result of Away Team
         ideas: what if have to get Arvonian AI to participate in the phantom whale ruse?
            e.g. transmit an Arvonian alert in Arvonian coded message?

1/2 ADD: cloaking device mechanics
         overlay a generic mesh 10% larger, with same shape as Light Cruiser but with a skybox texture
         a) remove CHASE_PLAYER block (but keep CHASE_ANGER)
         b) set CHASE_PLAYER to a very short radius

            * IF Diana cloak on
               AND Diana is nearby
               AND Artemis not nearby
               AND cloakedFromID is false
              THEN
               remove CHASE_PLAYER block
               set cloakedFromID to true
            * IF Diana cloak off
               AND cloakedFromID is true
              THEN
               add CHASE_PLAYER block
               set cloakedFromID to false
            * IF Diana is not nearby
               AND cloakedFromID is true
              THEN
               add CHASE_PLAYER block
               set cloakedFromID to false
            * IF Artemis is nearby
               AND cloakedFromID is true
              THEN
               add CHASE_PLAYER block
               set cloakedFromID to false

         Another option is to change player side to enemy when engage cloak
         Cloak should have a short timer (e.g., 15 seconds, with a 30 seconds recharge)

         Let's first experiment with the side value and see what the effect is
            * Add comms button to Diana to Engage Clock
