Question: How did the planet get trapped in the Nexus?  Was the Diana part of the cause?

Should the Crew get to start in the Diana with all the buffs of previous years? (plus repairs)
    Gravity well dampener
        Good work.  We have analyzed the signal you sent us and determined that the signal is 
        emanating from the wormhole itself.  SB01 has a prototype shuttle that can enter the 
        wormhole.  Any TSN ship larger than a Scout can dock at SB01 to pick it up.  We recommend 
        that you prepare an away team with an experienced engineer who can deal with the Diana.

        Aegis, we have installed the scout shuttle Ceres. Be advised that it is not designed for 
        battle, so we recommend that your Away Team launch it only when you are near the wormhole. 
        (You must select Scout as the type of Ceres in order to launch it.)

        Ceres has entered the wormhole.
    Whale attractor:
        We have analyzed the Cetrocite device schematic from the Diana.  Our research indicates 
        that such a device might be able to attract space whales within a range of about 25k.

Is there a way for a mission to test for when a specific upgrade is triggered?
    mission 1 used Cetrocite Crystals and a video from Colin Chick

In Mission 2, it was revealed that an Arvonian AI had been in the Diana from before it crashed
        We're interrogating the AI that took over the Diana.  It seems to be of Arvonian origin, 
        and was apparently dormant in a damaged memory bank long before the Diana was towed here 
        to DS1.  Recent repairs to the Diana must have reawakened it.  It seems possible that it 
        was somehow connected to the Diana's original fate from which it was rescued during the 
        recent Diana Operation.  More details will likely not be available until after you 
        complete this mission, however.

It was being interrogated and provides the hook for Mission 3, whatever it is
Could Comms have a way to ask questions of the AI during Mission 3?

Wrecked Ceres is still on Elysia (might have been repaired since then)
    Coolant and Energy were transferred to the Diana

Is there a way for a player ship to be cloaked to look like a space whale?  Can it be changed?
    What if spawn a generic mesh that wraps the player ship?

What if Elysia comes under attack and the Diana has to save them?

What is the Away Team mission this time?

Tip: Don't start with any empty ship, allow all spots to be occupied!

Canon question: how did this end?
    what year is it?  Torgoth/Arvonian vs TSN
    >2188 (nukes added)
    >2189 (Artemis class ship)
    >=2199 (Battleship added)
    >=2200 (Science vessel added)
    <= 2201 ? (TAK war ended)
    or
        2215-2219
    2220 (DS->Cmd Base upgrades)
    2235 TSN fighters appear
    2240 war

    lets a shuttle dock with a station somehow
