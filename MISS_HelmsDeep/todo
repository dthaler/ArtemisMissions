Ship 1 (TSN):
DONE Create a station and a carrier
DNTT Permanently disable the carrier's warp & impulse
DNTT Disallow creating a non-Strongbow
  OK Allow consoles for fighters, sensors (limited), and comms
DNTT Send an initial mission button after 15 seconds
 NO? Add a comms button to (re)play incoming message
DONE Start a timer and allow for placing defenses?  (how?)
DNTT create wall of asteroids where fighters can pass but not capital ships
   * create (say) torgoth or arvonian ships on the outside to siege
   * make wall be possible to shoot through
        Q: What else can be targeted by enemies besides players?
   * allow sending a "help" message via probes
   * goal is to hold out until reinforcements arrive
DNTT make sure station has ~infinite supply of fighters
        this may be automatic now per release notes?

Ship 2 (Pirate or Ximni or whatever)

Generic mesh
-----
 Will not block missiles
 But can block travel in a sphere (pushRadius)
 Can see out of it (texture not rendered if inside)
 Cannot see into it (see texture)
 Can have a huge DXS file

Asteroids
---------
 Can't block enemy ships from going through it

- Use mines
- AI Miner Layer(s)
- Fighters
- Gate

Anomalies
---------
Problem: anomaly shows up beyond range of sensors, and is scannable

Pirates farm resources from either asteroids (mine them)
 or loot other miners like Kralien miners
Get a score based on value of loot
Help request can come with a value
    is it fixed or does side 1 need to pick?
Ending screen shows pirate score
How build jump gate?
