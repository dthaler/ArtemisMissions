Ship 1 (TSN):
--------------
DNTT create wall of mines where fighters can pass but not capital ships
  OK make wall be possible to get through (mines)
        Q: What else can be targeted by enemies besides players?
   * allow sending a "help" message via probes
   * make sure station has ~infinite supply of fighters
        this may be automatic now per release notes?
        * how load fighters onto carrier?
          can't programmatically force dock (and can't use weapons to fire)

Ship 2 (Pirate):
------------------------------------
DONE Force creating a Pirate Strongbow with Warp drive
DNTT Send an initial mission message 15 seconds after it spawns
   * test ship creation
  https://artemis.forumchitchat.com/post/scripting-multiplayer-missions-8480239
     says it should work in Start block

                except that enemy stations show up beyond sensor range
                and so do named generic meshes
  DONE test Intrepid main screen joining after start
        DONE verify that Artemis comms message is received as expected
        DONE verify that Intrepid comms message is received as expected
        DONE verify that Artemis science looks as expected
        DONE verify that Intrepid science looks as expected
        DONE verify that GM view looks as expected
