Ship 1 (TSN):
DONE Create a station and a carrier
   * Permanently disable the carrier
   * Allow consoles for fighters, sensors (limited), and comms
   * Add a comms button to (re)play incoming message
   * Start a timer and allow for placing defenses?  (how?)
      * fighters cant drop things, maybe fighter locations are where wall goes?
DNTT create a wall of asteroids that fighters can fit through but not
     capital ships
   * create (say) torgoth or arvonian ships on the outside to siege
   * make wall be possible to shoot through
   * allow sending a "help" message via probes
   * goal is to hold out until reinforcements arrive
   * make sure station has ~infinite supply of fighters

Ship 2 (Pirate or Ximni or whatever)

Generic mesh
-----
Will not block missiles
But can block travel (pushRadius)
Can see out of it (texture not rendered if inside)
Cannot see into it (see texture)
Can have a huge DXS file

Asteroids
---------
Can't block enemy ships from going through it

What else can be targeted by enemies besides players?

- Use mines
- AI Miner Layer(s)
- Fighters
- Gate

Pirates farm resources from either asteroids (mine them)
 or loot other miners like Kralien miners
Get a score based on value of loot
Help request can come with a value
    is it fixed or does side 1 need to pick?
Ending screen shows pirate score
How build jump gate?

Problem: anomaly shows up beyond range of sensors, and is scannable
