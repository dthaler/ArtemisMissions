{

1/2 ADD: prevent probes from crossing the map, if possible
         one way would be to prevent any probes from existing
         which means some other way to send for help
         DONE write script to compute black hole death radius abt 500
         DONE add black holes to border
            * add generic meshes with pushRadius to border

1/2 ADD: TSN: allow sending a "help" message e.g., via probes
         could require a fighter to go out to it
         what is the range of a tag?

1/2 ADD: TSN: create wall of mines where fighters can pass but not capital ships
  OK make mine wall be possible to get through (mines)
        Q: What else can be targeted by enemies besides players?
    DNTT

1/2 ADD: TSN: make sure station has ~infinite supply of fighters
        this may be automatic now per release notes?
        * TSN: how load fighters onto carrier?
          can't programmatically force dock (and can't use weapons to fire)
        Only way seems to be to dock and undock, do we need a Helm
            console only to resupply?
