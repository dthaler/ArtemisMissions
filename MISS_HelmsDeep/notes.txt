Ship 1 (TSN):
--------------
  OK Allow consoles for fighters, sensors (limited), and comms

Generic mesh
-----
 Will not block missiles
 But can block travel in a sphere (pushRadius)
 Can see out of it (texture not rendered if inside)
 Cannot see into it (see texture) unless transparent texture?
 Can have a huge DXS file

Anomalies
---------
Problem: anomaly shows up beyond range of sensors, and is scannable

Asteroids
---------
 Can't block enemy ships from going through it

- Use mines
- AI Miner Layer(s)
- Fighters
- Gate

Pirates farm resources from either asteroids (mine them)
 or loot other miners like Kralien miners
Get a score based on value of loot
Help request can come with a value
    is it fixed or does side 1 need to pick?
Ending screen shows pirate score
How build jump gate?

Script limitations:
    Can't programmatically Request Dock
    Can't test if ship is warp or jump drive

The only way to force a ship to be warp vs jump is to call create player on it
    even for slot 1
Doing that for slot 1 will cause if_object_exists to be true
    but won't show on GM map if no consoles

    says it should work in Start block

except that enemy stations show up beyond sensor range
    and so do named generic meshes?
    so do mines, asteroids, etc.
