Ship 1 (TSN):
--------------
  OK Allow consoles for fighters, sensors (limited), and comms

Generic mesh
-----
Shows up beyond range of sensors
 Will NOT block missiles, including probes
    Bug was pointed out by Darrin in
    https://artemis.forumchitchat.com/post/show_single_post?pid=1303998068&postcount=118&forum=309504
 But can block travel in a sphere (pushRadius)
 Can see out of it (texture not rendered if inside)
 Cannot see into it (see texture) unless transparent texture?
 Can have a huge DXS file
 Scan text won't be updated on screen until scan again
    and no way to set scan level, can only destroy and recreate the mesh to
    force players to do another scan
Scan text 1 shows up when clicking on
Single scan shows scan text 2, at scan level 1

Black holes
-----
Shows up beyond range of sensors
Can block probes and other missiles

Anomalies
---------
Problem: anomaly shows up beyond range of sensors, and is scannable

Wrecks
------
Does NOT show up beyond range of sensors
Any way to prevent them from spawning anomalies when destroyed?
    or to control what they spawn?
Does not show scan text 1 or 2, always shows fixed text
if_scan_level does work

Asteroids
---------
Shows up beyond range of sensors
 Can't block enemy ships from going through it

- Use mines
- AI Miner Layer(s)
- Fighters
- Gate

Pirates farm resources from either asteroids (mine them)
 or loot other miners like Kralien miners
Get a score based on value of loot
Help request can come with a value
    is it fixed or does side 1 need to pick?
Ending screen shows pirate score
How build jump gate?

Script limitations:
    Can't programmatically Request Dock
    Can't test if ship is warp or jump drive

The only way to force a ship to be warp vs jump is to call create player on it
    even for slot 1
Doing that for slot 1 will cause if_object_exists to be true
    but won't show on GM map if no consoles

    says it should work in Start block

except that enemy stations show up beyond sensor range
    and so do named generic meshes?
    so do mines, asteroids, etc.

There is no way to make hangar bay contents be empty, either on creation
or afterwards

What else can be targeted by enemies besides players?
    ATTACK: any named object (supposedly)

What can be targeted by players to "mine"?
    Mike Substelny posted 2/22/18:
        At last the Science Console can interact with a Generic Mesh!

        You should be able to use fields (I think ship_text?) for Generic
        Meshes. Science can scan them just like enemy ships. In addition to a
        name they should have a scan_level, a race, a class, a scan_text . . .
        I believe Generic Meshes have everything but a hail_text. If you want
        players to communicate with a Generic Mesh you must use the Comms
        buttons.

        This will be very powerful!

        Weapons cannot target a Generic Mesh, but I think you can simulate it
        by pinning a Wreck inside the Mesh. Alternatively, if you want players
        to be able to shoot at a Generic Mesh that absorbs tons of damage, pin
        an unarmed cargo or luxury liner inside the Mesh, name it
        appropriately, and boost its shields to 1,000.

        The disadvantage is that the longer the "ship" exists the more                  likely it is that Communications will realize he/she can talk                   to the asteroid. :-)

 Q: do they BOTH need to be named? A: yes
 Q: which one is the main one for scanning purposes?
 A: WithWreck is clickable, and shows minerals left
    Wr1 can still be selected with 'i' key
 Q: Can we name then "A0" and "A0_" or something?
