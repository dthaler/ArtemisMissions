possible conditions:
      * donate energy (100 units)
      * donate a DamCon team
      * deliver cargo/data from X to Y
         First, {rendezvous,dock} with
         and {download some data,pick up some supplies} we need.
         Then, {rendezvous,dock} with us, and we'll
      * "Our sensors are all down!  We're flying blind. Please guide us to a station for repairs!"
      * shipboard computer haywire, can't reboot it

possible rewards:
      * give you more engineering coolant.  (totalCoolant += 2)
   ++ * give you two more nuclear torpedoes.  (countNuke += 2)
        charge your batteries.                (energy += N)
      * enhance your shield generators.     (shieldMaxStateFront/Back += N)
        double our production speed.

        500 Energy
        Restore DamCon team
        Doubles heat loss caused by coolant (no because used Cetrocite last time)
        Scanning becomes instant for 5 minutes (no)
        10% Buff to Beam recharge rate
        10% buff to Warp and Impulse speed
        10% buff to Shields recharge rate
        Auto surrender (no)
      * increase sensor range on ALL ships
      * increase Player Weapon Power % on ALL ships
      * increase Player Shield Strength % on ALL ships
      * increase topSpeed permanently
      * increase turnRate permanently
      * increase shieldMaxStateFront/shieldMaxStateBack permanently
      * add homing torps
      * add nukes
      * add mines
      * add EMPs
      * add energy
      * add coolant
      * disable triggersMines

        * probably need to replace station with a different station

           Civilian/Science -> DeepSpace : 2x production & add beams
           Civilian/Science -> Industrial: 6x production
                this is possible
           Civilian/Science -> Command   : 4x production & add beams & add torps
           Deep Space       -> Command   : 2x production & add torps & 2x shields
                last one is possible if "upgrade energy output"
